### We're building a modern authorization server to authenticate your users and protect your APIs.

#### Simplified Security
- Share user accounts between multiple apps and services with Single Sign-On (shared sessions)
- Issue signed JSON Web Tokens to protect your APIs
- Be a federated identity provider with OpenID Connect
- Enable third-party developers using two- and three-legged OAuth 2.0

#### Flexible User Authentication
- Use local passwords, OAuth 1.0, OAuth 2.0, OpenID, SAML 2.0, LDAP, Active Directory, and more
- Works out of the box with Google, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, and a [growing list of providers](https://github.com/christiansmith/anvil-connect/tree/master/providers)
- Custom schemes using virtually any existing Passport.js strategy or your own code

#### Make it yours
- Brand the interface with your own design
- Use middleware hooks for domain specific implementations
- Keep your changes under version control without forking

#### Standard, Interoperable, and Open Source
- Language and platform agnostic
- Implements widely accepted, well-understood protocols
